The files here in this repository are supplemental material for the paper submitted to Applied Energy entitled "Integrated Pumped Hydro Reverse Osmosis System Optimization Featuring Surrogate Model Development in Reverse Osmosis Modeling":

Haefner_IPHROS_MOGA.m - MATLAB file that runs the optimization of the IPHRO system using a multiobjective genetic algorithm

Haefner_Aw_Eqn_Analysis.jmp - JMP project that includes the analysis used in developing Equation 41 for the membrane water permeability coefficient

Haefner_R_Eqn_Analysis_JMP.jmp - JMP project that includes the analysis used to determine that the fractional salt rejection rate is a function of the permeate flowrate

Haefner_R_Eqn_Formulation.m - MATLAB file that compares different models for fitting an equation for the fractional salt rejection rate and generates Equation 37

Haefner_WAVE_Simulations.xlsx - data from WAVE simulations

Haefner_WAVE_Simulations_trimmed.xlsx - a reduced version of HAEFNER_WAVE_simulations.xlsx that does not include any WAVE simulations that generate an "RO Design Warning" or have a permeate flowrate of zero due to rounding in WAVE 

Opt Results.xlsx - Excel file with optimization results. This file is used in analyzing_converged_results_V2.m. This is a temporary file. Once made official, it will be renamed Haefner_...

analyzing_converged_results_v2.m - MATLAB file used to generate figures for processing optimization results. This file uses Opt Results.xlsx. This is a temporary file. Once made official, it will be renamed Haefner_...
